        <h1>About me:</h1>
        Welcome to my website. I'm from New Hampshire. I'm a third year Mathematics and Statistics student at Reed College expecting to graduate in 2027. Some of my interests include:
	<ul>
	    <li>Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers</li>
	    <li>Mathematical Statistics</li>
            <li><a href="/html/baking.html">Baking</a> and <a href="/html/cooking.html">Cooking</a></li>
	    <li>Information Theory</li>
	    <li>Biking</li>
            <li>Hiking near my home</li>
	    <li>Linux Package Management</li>
        </ul>
	Like all things, this website is only a work in progress. Right now, especially so. If you come back later there might be something new.
