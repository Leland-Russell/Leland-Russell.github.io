\noindent \desc{These are a newer favorite of mine. They are also quite simple, but take some resting time because they use a butter dough. I've found them to be quite mellow but also pretty addictive. Whenever I make these at school, they take quite a bit longer than 10 minutes to prepare the dough because I don't have a stand mixer, but it should be quite a bit faster with one. Finally, as with most butter dough's, make sure you actually chill the dough. If you want to see what a difference it makes, try making one immediately and then one after chilling, the first one will share many more attributes with a puddle.}

\recipe{
\begin{ingredients}
\item 100g (1 stick) butter
\item 100g ($\frac{1}{2}$ cup) sugar
\item 275g (2 cups) flour
\item 1 egg
\item 1 tsp baking soda 
\item $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp salt
\item 1 tsp ground ginger
\item 1 tsp ground cinnamon
\item 2 tsp ground cardamom
\item 1 tsp ground nutmeg
\item 2 tsp vanilla extract
\end{ingredients}
}{
\begin{directions}
\item Cream butter and sugar in a stand mixer.
\item Incorporate all the other ingredients. The dough will likely be quite dry, don't be concerned if it's mostly crumbs
\item Chill dough for an hour, preheat oven to 400 Farenheit.
\item With your hands, shape dough into small balls ensuring each is somewhere around 15 g - 25 g *
%\item[4b.] Roll the dough into a long roll and cut into even pieces, shaping into balls 
\item Bake for around 10 minutes or until the bottoms are golden on a greased baking sheet or parchment paper. Fridge the remaining dough while these bake.
\item Let cool for around 10 minutes or until the cookies are solid after coming out of the oven.
\end{directions} 

\note{Without a scale, this can be done by rolling the down into a long roll and cutting into even pieces. Each should be around a large tbsp in volume}
