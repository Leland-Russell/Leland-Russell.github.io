\noindent \desc{Originally, these cookies were made from the apparently somewhat well known \href{https://www.food.com/recipe/neiman-marcus-250-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe-13307}{\$250 cookie recipe}, but they have developed into something quite different at this point. Now they are just whatever toppings I want to have in cookies. The butter can be easily substituted for coconut oil at which point there's no reason to rest the cookies. Also, it's a very large recipe, it always makes more than I think it will.} \\

\recipe{
\begin{ingredients}
\item 225g (1 cup) butter
\item 100g ($\frac{1}{2}$ cup) sugar
\item 140g ($\frac{2}{3}$ cup) brown sugar
\item 2 eggs
\item 2 tsp vanilla
\item 225g (2 $\frac{1}{2}$ cups) oatmeal
\item 250g (2 cups) flour
\item $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp salt
\item 1 tsp baking soda
\item 1 tsp baking powder
\item 20g ($\frac{1}{4}$ cup) cocoa powder

\end{ingredients}
}{
\begin{directions}
\item Preheat the oven to 375 Farenheit. Cream together butter and sugars. Add egg and vanilla.
\item For a finer cookie, grind half the oats a little bit in a blender. In a separate bowl, add all dry ingredients up to (and excluding) the chocolate chips.
\item Add the dry to the wet and add the chocolate and nuts to the batter.
\item Rest cookies in the fridge for twenty minutes
\item Cook large cookies for 10 minutes on a greased or parchment-paper-lined baking sheet

\note{The chocolate chips can really be substituted for anything. I once turned these into raisin cookies by adding a bit more cinnamon and adding a bunch of raisins instead of chocolate. You could add more nuts. You also could make these more like chocolate cookies by laying back on some of the spices and nuts and maybe adding in a little bit more sugar. These cookies can be whatever you want them to be.}
