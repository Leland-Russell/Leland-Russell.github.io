1. Get JavaScript to work to randomly choose an image of me when someone opens the site
    a. This could easily be extended to change it on click
    b. There's some nuance here because navigating to other pages re-makes the sidebar, and I wouldn't want it to do a new image each time.
	i. I could just only have images on the index page, that's certainly a solution.
    c. For cycling through images. https://people.reed.edu/~jerry has *an* example, but I'd like to iterate through directory files
    d. This would require me to import packages which my browser really doesn't like.
	i. I've looked at a few stack exchange pages to no avail. Surely I can get something to work though.
2. Get custom footnotes in my style file for recipes
    a. Can't use `\footnote{}` in an ingredient list because then it puts the note in the wrong section.
3. Look into the Makefile error when calling `make all` in recipes/baking or recipes/cooking
    a. It compiles all but then error's, maybe it's an error in the make $(foreach ·, ·, ·)
    b. It's not actually a problem because I can pass -k when calling it in recipes/Makefile
4. It would be nice to add JavaScript for changing between light background and dark text and dark background and light text
    a. Like with the image, this would have to persist across multiple pages
5. It could be kind of fun to have like a blog with stuff. I'm not sure how much I'd have there, but could be fun.
