\noindent \desc{Perhaps I have a tendency to call things tarts when they really aren't, but here we are. This recipe was originally taken from Nichole Accetola's \href{https://www.kantinesf.com/cookbook-scandinavian-from-scratch}{Scandinavian from Scratch} cookbook. There it is a strawberry almond tart with a whipped cream sort of custard topping, this was very good. I've made a few modifications with respect to changing the crust, some proportions, and adding a few bits here and there.  It can be kept with something closer to the listed topping, or for a richer desert, this can be substituted with chocolate quite easily.}
