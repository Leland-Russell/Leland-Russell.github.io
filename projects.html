	    <li><h3> Math 343: <a href="projects/Math343_Comparator_Colleges_Report.pdf">Comparing the Comparators of Reed College</a> 
		<div class="date"> Fall 2025 </div>
		<div class="small-text"> This was the project I worked on for Math 343: Statitistics Practicum. We worked with the office for institutional research to develop a method for finding and assesing possible comparator colleges for Reed. This class was entirely project based, so I worked on this with my group-mates for the semester. I worked with <a href="https://github.com/n-lincoln" style="text-decoration: none;">Nat Lincoln</a> and <a href="https://github.com/acadiamacdonald" style="text-decoration: none;">Acadia McDonald</a>. </div>

	    <li><h3> REU - Hampton University: <a href="projects/Summer_2025_HU_presentation.pdf">Neural Network Clustering Methods on VIIRS Data</a> 
		<div class="date"> Summer 2025 </div>
		<div class="small-text"> These were the slides I gave during my REU at Hampton University. I did research on clustering methods for satellite images of clouds. I was trying to see if we could use a neural network scheme to cluster the clouds better then more usual methods like K-Means.</div>

	    <li><h3> Math 392: <a href="projects/Math392_Order_Statistics_Report.pdf">Order Statistics</a></h3>
		<div class="date"> Spring 2024 </div>
		<div class="small-text"> This was my final Project for Math 392: Order Statistics. We were given Order Statistics to present on. I was responsible for doing most of the proofs for the theoretical foundations and asymptotics. I was working with two other students in the class.</div>

	    <li><h3> Math 243: <a href="projects/Math243_Asteroids_Report.pdf">Breaking news: This Rock Might be a Problem</a></h3>
		<div class="date"> Spring 2024 </div> 
		<div class="small-text"> This was my final project for Math 243: Statistical Learning. We used mixed effects and generalized linear models to predict NASA's method for classifying asteroids as potentially hazardous to Earth. I did this with two classmates, Sofia DeAngelis and Lima Popal.</div>

	    <li> <h3> Math 391: <a href="projects/Math391_Shannon_Report.pdf">Shannon's Noisy Channel</a> </h3>
		<div class="date"> Fall 2024</div>
		<div class="small-text"> This was my final project for Math 391: Probability. I went through a proof of Shannon's Noisy Channel accessibly at the undergraduate level. </div>
